# PB&J Theme

## Concept
No, PB&J does infact not stand for Peanut Butter and Jelly. I recently got very fond of pitch black themes and noticed a lack of them. I wanted to create one myself.  
Now Pitch Black -> PB, which gave me a fun idea. What if I call the theme PB&J and use pitch black as the main background color and colors whose name start with J  
as the other colors. If it proves too hard, then atleast the primary accent color has to start with J, for example Pitch Black and Jaffa (Jaffa is a shade of orange
apparently) or something like that.
